DEFINITION
----------

The DETACHED SERVER format allows for fast game server deployment,
and your server-side game logic will be hosted like a website.


TUTORIAL
--------

freezing a bundle, then:
 [1]..... copying the source-code that corresponds to the "netcode" 
 [2]..... copying the source-code of PYV (the engine) 
in the current folder, 

will produce a DETACHED SERVER.

 Inside such a folder you'll always find:
- main.py
- the "netcode" folder
- the "pyved_engine" folder
